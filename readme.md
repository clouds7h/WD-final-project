## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project: This project is a Personal Website. The goal is to create a website with 5 distinct pages. For my Personal Website, I added 5 different pages. I labeled the first page as my homepage. This contains a brief information about me as well as a photo. I also added a navbar across all pages in order to navigate easily across the different pages. As for the second page, I opted to create a page solely dedicated for my Resume. This contains details such as my academic background as well as the skillset that I currently have. The third page contains a showcase of my previous projects in this subject. It contains three cards that would direct you to the deployed websites when clicked. For the fourth page is a gallery of images rendered as part of my submission for my IT004. To showcase the images, I opted to place them in a rotating gallery. Lastly, the contact page. This page contains may contact information such as phone number and email addresses as well. I also placed my Home Adress as well as a clickable-icon that would lead to my social media accounts.
- Whats the purpose: The purpose of this project is to show and demonstrate the design skills and the amount of web development knoweledge that we have acquired. It will also serve as our portfolio. 
- What are key components: As for the key components, it is a must to have at least 5 distinct pages. A resume-like information is a must as well and lastly a showcase containing the past works that you did. 
- What technology used and how it is used: For this project I utilized the use of HTML and CSS. I used no JS for this one.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
